<h3>Capitalization Rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cap rate = rNOI - gNOI</li>

<h3>Measuring the Cap Rate</h3>

<li>Market Extraction Method (ME)<br />
</li>
<li>Band-of-Investment Method (BOI)<br />
</li>
<li>Built-Up Method (BU)</li>
</ol>
<p>3.) Built-Up Method (BU)<br />
* The built-up method depends on macroeconomic factors, and is generally used when comparables are not present. The built-up method doesn’t consider the method of financing.</p>
<p>C0 = pure rate + liquidity premium + recapture premium + risk premium.</p>
<p>2.) Band-of-Invesment Method (BOI)<br />
The BOI utilizes a WACC as an estimate of the market capitalization rate. It is appropriate for properties that utilize both debt and equity financing. In the BOI method, we adjust the capitalization rate by adding a sinking fund factor.</p>
<p>Sinking Fund Factor</p>
<p>SFF = PMT(i/12, n*12, PV = 0, FV = -1)</p>
<p>Annual Mortgage Cost = annual YTM + SFF (%)</p>
<p>C0 = WACC = (mortgage weight x mortgage cost) + (equity weight x equity cost).</p>

<div id="recaptured-depreciation" class="section level2">
<h2>Recaptured Depreciation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recaptured depreciation represents depreciation that was taken in anticipation of a decline in the value of an asset that ultimately did not materialize.</li>
<li>Recaptured depreciation = Accumulated depreciation (A/D)</li>
<li>Tax on recaptured depreciation = Accumulated depreciaiton * tax on recaptured depreciation<br />
Tax on capital gains = tax rate on capital gains * (capital gain - recaptured depreciation)</li>
</ul>

<div id="private-equity-valuation" class="section level2">
<h2>Private Equity Valuation</h2>
<p>Definitions<br />
Portfolio Company - companies that private equity firms invest in<br />
Private Equity Firm - companies that create portfolios of portfolio companies and allow PE investors to invest in<br />
Private Equity Investor - outside investors who makes an investment in a fund offered by the PE firm</p>
<div id="unique-sources-of-value-for-private-equity-investments" class="section level3">
<h3>Unique Sources of Value for Private Equity Investments</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ability to re-engineer the firm for efficiency</li>
<li>Ability to acquire debt at favorable terms</li>
<li>Superior alignment of interests between managers and owners</li>
</ol>
<div id="definitions" class="section level4">
<h4>Definitions</h4>
<ul>

</li>
<li>Tag-Along, Drag-Along Clauses - the requirement that an acquiring firm extend the acquisition offer to all shareholders, including firm management</li>
<li>Board Representation - The private equity firm is ensured control through board representation in a major event<br />

</ul>
<p>Priority in Claims - Private equity firms receive their distributions before other owners<br />
Required Approvals - Changes of strategic importance must be approved by the private equity firm<br />
Earn-Outs - These tie the acquisition price paid by the private equity firm to the portfolio company’s future performance over a specified time period.</p>

<h2>Adjustments for Probability of Failure</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If the probability of failure in any given year is expected to remain constant, use…</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm {\large {r_{adj} = \frac{1 + r_{unadj}} {1 - Pr(failure)} - 1}}\)</span></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If the probability of failure in any given year is expected to change each year, adjust each year’s expected cash flows to reflect the Probability of failure ($0 cash flow, Pr(failure)) or adjust the expected exit value.</li>

</div>
<div id="the-basic-venture-capital-method" class="section level2">
<h2>The Basic Venture Capital Method</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Step 1: Determine the post-money valuation (“POST”)</p>
<pre><code>+ $\mathrm {\large {POST =  \frac{\text{Exit Value}} {(1 + r)^t}}}$
+ The only positive cash flow (capital gain, no dividends) in this model occurs at the time of exit (typically an IPO or acquisition)
+ The Exit Value is an estimate of the value of a company at the time of an exit event, be it an IPO or an acquisition
+ $\mathrm {\large {\text {Exit Value} = \text{Earnings Multiple} \times \text{Estimate of terminal earnings}}}$
+ $\mathrm {\large {\text {Exit Value} = \text{PV(expected future cash flows)}}}$
+ Exit Value measures the value of the company in the case of _success_</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Step 2: Determine the pre-money valuation (“PRE”)</p>
<pre><code>+ $\mathrm {\large {\text {PRE} = \text{POST - Investment}}}$</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Step 3: Determine the ownership fraction for the investor (f)
+ <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm {\large {f = \frac{\text{Investment}} {POST}}}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Step 4: Determine the number of investor shares (“y”)</p></li>
<li><p>Step 5: Determine the price per share</p></li>

<div id="investing-in-commodities" class="section level2">
<h2>Investing in Commodities</h2>
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)<br />
U.S. regulator of futures trading</p>
<p>Long-only investment in commodities is usually obtained via collateralized long positions in commodity futures, forwards, or swaps.</p>
<p>Contango Normal Contango<br />
Futures price &gt; Spot price Futures price &gt; E(Spot price)</p>
<p>Backwardation Normal Backwardation<br />
Spot price &gt; Futures price E(Spot price) &gt; Futures price</p>
</div>
<div id="commodity-futures-returns" class="section level2">
<h2>Commodity Futures Returns</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Collateral yield - the return on cash used as margin to take long derivatives exposure<br />
</li>
<li>Roll yield - the return from rolling forward the maturity of the derivatives position by closing out a current position and entering a new contract.
<ul>
<li>The long position experiences positive roll yields when markets are in backwardation; the long investor can buy the the commodity below the current spot price from a hedger.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spot yield - the return on the spot asset</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="commodity-prices-decline-for-the-following-reasons-shifts-in-demandsupply" class="section level2">
<h2>Commodity prices decline for the following reasons (shifts in demand/supply):</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Introduction of new supplies and new production technology</li>
<li>Subsitutiton of one commodity for another when prices rise 3. Reduction in the use of certain commodities in technological processes</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="supply-and-demand" class="section level2">
<h2>Supply and Demand</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of the fluctuation in commodity prices comes from changes in demand. Changes in supply are usually smaller and slower to respond.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today’s commodities market is no longer dominated by hedgers and natural backwardation and can move towards backwardation or contango.</p>
<p>At the maturity date of the futures contract, the investor can either take physical delivery of the commodity or roll the futures contract, which means buying another contract with a new maturity date.</p>
<p>The risk-return profile of commmodities over the past 25 years is similar to that of U.S. equities.</p>
<p>Commodities tend to have a negative correlation with equities and therefore provide some diversification benefits.</p>
<p>Portfolio optimization techniques suggest that portfolios should contain about 15-25% of commodities.</p>
