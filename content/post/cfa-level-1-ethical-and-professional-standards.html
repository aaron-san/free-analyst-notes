<pre><code>Must disassociate from any illegal activity and actively urge the firm (either an immediate supervisor or a compliance officer) to cease any conduct that violates the law or an applicable regulation or standard.

                                                    </code></pre>

Gifts that are accepted for prior performance and not contingent on future performance don&#39;t threaten objectivity

Ownership of an analyzed stock is not a violation, but significant ownership could reasonably be expected to impair judgment                                                    
Best practice is to disclose ownership of a covered stock to the employer and in the investment report
