## Statistical Inference	

* Hypothesis Testing (testing validity of parameters)													
Estimation (estimation of parameters)														
														
## Sampling Bias	

###  Data Mining	

* **Out-of-Sample Test:** using a sample that does not overlap the time period of the variable under consideration
* **Intergenerational Data Mining:** Involves repeatedly using data generated from prior researchers until a pattern is discovered
* A **data-mining bias** occurs when variables are added to an analysis that don't have any predictive value (i.e., no causal relationship).

### Sample Selection Bias           

* Using only data that is available

### Survivorship Bias	

* Excluding data that is discontinued
* Sometimes databases remove firms just because there will be no future updates to the data. When the data is removed, the overall performance of the entire data set is increased.

## Look-ahead Bias	

* Using data that is not currently available to every market participant						

## Time-period Bias	

* Using data that is inherently influenced by a specific time-period that skews the results					

## Estimators ("U-E-C")
    
* Unbiased ("U")
    + The expected value of the estimator equals the value of the parameter
* Efficient ("E")
    + The variance of the estimator is the least of all other estimators of the parameter
* Consistent ("C")
    + The probability that the estimator equals the parameter increases with increasing sample size
      
## Skewed Distribution	

|    |     |
| :---------- | :----------: |
| None | Mode = Median = Mean |
| Left Skew | Mode > Median > Mean |
| Right Skew | Mode < Median < Mean |

														
| Z | Confidence  | Z  | Confidence  |
| :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-------: |
| 1.65	| 90%	| 1	| 68% |
| 1.96	| 95%	| 2	| 95% |									
| 2.58	| 99%	| 3	| 99% |										
												
## Confidence Interval 			

* Probabilistic interpretation:  
    + *"__% of the resulting confidence intervals will, in the long run, contain the population parameter."*
* Practical interpretation:  
    + *"We are __% confident the given confidence interval contains the population parameter."*
    
## Total Probability Rule	

$\mathrm {\large {P(A) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) + P(A|C) \cdot P(C)) }}$

## Addition Rule of Probability	

$\mathrm {\large {P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)}}$
														
## Multiplication Rule of Probability	

$\mathrm {\large {P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)}}$
														
## Steps in Hypothesis Testing		

1. State hypothesis	
2. Decide the test statistics and probability distribution
3. Choose a significance level
4. Choose a decision rule
5. Collect data and calculate the test statistic				
6. Make a statistical decision
7. Make an economic decision

## Power of  a Test			

* If the null hypothesis is false and is rejected, then a correct decision was made. If the null hypothesis is false but is not rejected, an error was made and the probability of making this error is the **power** of a test.
* In other words, the **power** is the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis

$\mathrm {\large {Power = 1 - \beta = 1 - P(\text {Type II error}) }}$

## Labeling

* How many ways can k labels can be assigned to n items?
* The number of items that receive label 1 is n1, where n1 + n2 + n3 + ... + nk = n	
														
$\mathrm {\large {\frac{n!} {n_1! \space \cdot \space n_2! \space \cdot \space ... \space \cdot \space n_k!}}}$

## Test for Population Mean (Z-stat)	

* Assumptions:
    + Known variance (or unknown if n $\geq$ 30)
    + Normal distribution (or non-normal if n $\geq$ 30)
    
## Test for Population Mean (T-Stat)	

* Assumptions:													
    + Unknown variance AND either:
        1. sample is large (n $\geq$ 30) or...
        2. sample is small, but the population is at least approximately normally distributed				
														
## Test of Mean Differences (T Statistic)	            

* Assumptions:				
      * Normally distributed populations
      * Unknown population variances
      
## Test for Difference Between Means (t-stat)			

### Method 1 

* Assumptions:
    + Normally distributed populations,				
    + Independent populations
    + Population variances unknown, but assumed equal
      
$\mathrm {\large {t = \frac{ (x_1 - x_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2) } {\sqrt{\left( \frac{s_p^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_p^2}{n_2} \right)} } }}$

$\mathrm {\large {df = n1 + n2 - 2}}$

$\mathrm {\large {s_p^2 = \frac{ (n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2 } { n_1 + n_2 - 2} } }$

### Method 2

* Assumptions:		
    + Normally distributed populations				
    + Independent populations
    + Unequal and unknown population variances
    
$\mathrm {\large {t = \frac{ (x_1 - x_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2) } {\sqrt{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)} } }}$

$\mathrm {\large {df = \frac{\left( \frac{ s_1^2 } {n_1} + \frac{ s_2^2 } {n_2}\right)^2} {\frac{\left(s_1^2 / n_1 \right)^2} {n_1} + \frac{\left(s_2^2 / n_2 \right)^2} {n_2} }}}$
														
In majority of cases, the T-test is used!														

### Test for significant difference in two means

* Assumptions:
    + Normally distributed populations
    + Dependent populations		

$\mathrm {\large {t = \frac{ \bar d - d_{zs} } { s_{\bar d} / \sqrt n }}}$													
						
Note: Stocks are generally considered to be dependent (both rely on market returns)														
	
	
	
														
		Test Statistic												
When sampling from a:		Small Sample	Large Sample											
		n<30	n>30											
Normal distribution, known variance		z	z											
														
Normal distribution, unknown  variance		t	t or z											
														
Nonnormal distribution, known variance		not available	z	Central Limit Theorem										
														
Nonnormal distribution,  unknown variance		not available	t or z	Central Limit Theorem										
														
														
Types of Risk														
Default risk - risk that a security will lose value due to a firm's default														
Liquidity risk - risk of receiving less than the fair value for an asset if it must be sold quickly														
Maturity risk - risk of higher volatility of longer maturity instruments (particularly with bonds)														
										
RRORbond = real risk-free rate + inflation premium + default risk premium + liquidity premium + maturity premium

## Test for Variance (1 population - $??^2$)	

* Assumptions:	
* Normally distributed population														
$??^2$ distribution approaches the normal distribution as the sample size increases

## Test for Equality of Variances (2 populations - F-dist)	

* Assumptions:					
      * Normally distributed populations
      * Independent distributions														
Rejection region is in the right tail of the F-distribution (if s21 is the greater sample variance)

## Power of a Test			

* 1-P(Type II Error)
