<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assumptions:
* Value is determined by supply and demand
* Supply and demand is driven by both rational and irrational behavior<br />
* Prices move in trends that persist for long periods</li>
</ul>
<p>Causes of changes in supply and demand are difficult to determine<br />
## Main challenge to technical analysis is the EMH</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentalists look for reasons why prices should change and realize the change when they find a reason for it to change<br />
EMH theory contends that prices adjust quickly to new information<br />
Technical analysts contend that prices adjust slowly to new information</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost without exception, EMH studies using autocorrelation and runs tests have found no evidence that prices move in trends.</p>
<p>Strategies<br />
Contrarian - most investors are wrong, so do the opposite<br />
Follow the smart money - “jumping on the bandwagon”</p>
<p>Indictors<br />
Momentum indicators - focus on direction of market<br />
Price- and volume-based indicators - focus on market data</p>

<h2>Contrarian Rules</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cash position of mutual funds - need for liquidity (mutual fund ratio = mutual fund cash / total fund assets; a ratio &gt; 11% suggests MF managers are bearish; a ratio &lt; 4% suggests MF managers are bullish)<br />
</li>
<li>Investor credit balances in brokerage accounts - need for liquidity (credit balances are uninvested cash)<br />
</li>
<li>Opinions of investment advisory services - relative view of analysts<br />
</li>
<li>Over-the-counter vs. NYSE volume - Over-the-counter trading is more speculative<br />
</li>
<li>CBOE put/call ratio - puts outstanding/calls outstanding<br />
5.) Stock index futures - observe expected price growth</li>
</ol>
<p>Smart Money Rules<br />
Confidence index = quality bond yields/average bond yields</p>
<p>In periods of confidence, investors sell high-quality bonds (increasing their yields) and buy lower-quality bonds (decreasing their yields), decreasing the yield spread</p>
<p>In periods of pessimism, investors buy high-quality bonds (decreasing their yields) and sell lower-quality bonds (increasing their yields), increasing the yield spread</p>
<p>T-bill-Eurodollar yield spread - measures international crises and use of U.S. safe havens<br />
Debit balances in brokerage accounts (margin debt)</p>
<p>Momentum Indicators<br />
Breadth of market<br />
Stocks above their 200-day moving average</p>
<p>Stock Price and Volume Techniques<br />
Dow Theory - stock prices move in trends<br />
Importance of volume - Price changes on low volume tell us little. Price changes on high volume tell us whether suppliers or demanders are driving the change.</p>
<p>Support and resistance levels<br />
Price Channels</p>
<p>Relative Strength (RS) - RS = stock price / market index value</p>
<p>Underlying technical analysis are the following assumptions:<br />
1) Values, and thus prices, are determined by supply and demand.<br />
2) Supply and demand are driven by both rational and irrational behavior.<br />
3) Security prices move in trends that persist over long periods.<br />
4) While the causes of changes in supply and demand are difficult to determine, the actual shifts in supply and demand can be observed in market price behavior.<br />
The major challenge to technical analysis is the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).</p>
<p>Fundemantalists believe they can forecast value changes by analyzing earnings and other publicly available data.<br />
Fundamentalists believe prices adjust quickly.<br />
EMH advocates believe the price adjustment to new information happens almost instantaneously.<br />
Fundamentalists, through their research, look for changes in the basis of value, which eventually leads to change in the supply and demand for the stock.<br />
Technicians look for evidence of changes in supply and demand through market signals and indicators.</p>
