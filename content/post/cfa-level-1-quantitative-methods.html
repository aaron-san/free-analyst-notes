<p>Shortfall Risk<br />
Risk that a return will fall below a specifided target level</p>
<p>Safety-First Rule<br />
SFRatio</p>
<pre><code>If returns are normally distributed, the safety-first optimal portfolio maximizes the safety-first ratio (SFRatio).                                                 
The farther from the limiting return, the greater the spread between E(RP) and RL.

<p>Price Relative</p>
<p>Continuously Compounded Return</p>
<p>Independent and Identically Distributed (IID)<br />
Key assumption for asset returns<br />
Independence - investors cannot use past returns to predict future returns (i.e. weak-form market efficiency)<br />
Indentical Distribution - mean and variance do not change with time</p>
<p>Annualizing<br />
Annualizing is often done on the basis of a 250 days in a year, the approximate number of days markets are open for trading. (p. 452)</p>
<p>Volatility<br />
The instantaneous standard deviation.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo Simulation<br />
A simulation of potential outcomes (“what ifs”) with time<br />
Used to assess risk<br />
Consists of multiple simulations of outcome using predetermined probability distributions.<br />
Each simulation trial involves a drawing of random values<br />
Uses time increments and general assumptions about risk factors (growth, volatility, etc.)<br />
Cannot provide the insight that analytic methods can!</p>
<p>Asian Call Option<br />
European-style option with value at maturity equal to difference between the stock price at maturity and the average stock price during the life of the option or $0, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Hedging Horizon<br />
Time span over which the hedging position will be maintained</p>
<p>Lookback Call Option<br />
A call option with value at maturity equal to the stock value at maturity less the minimum value of the stock during the lift of the option prior to maturity, or zero, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Statistical Inference<br />
Hypothesis Testing (testing validity of parameters)<br />
Estimation (estimation of parameters)</p>
<p>Sampling Bias<br />
Data Mining<br />
??? Out-of-Sample Test: using a sample that does not overlap the time period of the variable under consideration<br />
??? Intergenerational Data Mining: repeatedly using data produced by prior researchers until a pattern is discovered<br />
??? A data-mining bias occurs when variables are added to an analysis without any predictive merit (i.e., there is no causal relationship for adding the variables). The variables are not added to enhance prediction, but to thwart the predictive relationship between other variables.</p>
<p>Sample Selection Bias<br />
Using data availability as a criteria for sampling</p>
<p>Survivorship Bias<br />
Excluding data that is discontinued (defaulted firms)</p>
<p>Look-ahead Bias<br />
Using data that is not currently available to every market participant</p>
<p>Time-period Bias<br />
Using data that is inherently influenced by a specific time-period that skews the results</p>
<p>Estimators</p>
<p>“UEC”</p>
<p>Unbiased<br />
The expected value of the estimator equals the value of the parameter<br />
Efficient<br />
The variance of the estimator is the least of all other estimators of the parameter<br />
Consistent<br />
The probability that the estimator equals the paramater increases with increasing sample size</p>

No Skew: Mode = Median = Mean<br />
Left Skew: Mode &gt; Median &gt; Mean<br />

<p>Confidence Interval<br />
Probabilistic interpretation: <strong>% of the resulting confidence intervals will, in the long run, contain the population parameter<br />
Practical interpretation: We are </strong>% confident the given confidence interval contains the population parameter</p>
<p>Total Probability Rule<br />
Pr(A) = Pr(A|B)Pr(B) + Pr(A|C)Pr(C)</p>
<p>Addtion Rule of Probability<br />

<p>Power of a Test<br />
1-P(Type II Error)</p>
<p>Technical Analysis</p>
<p>Assumptions:<br />
Value is determined by supply and demand<br />
Supply and demand is driven by both rational and irrational behavior<br />
Prices move in trends that persist for long periods<br />
Causes of changes in supply and demand are difficult to determine</p>
<p>Main challenge to technical analysis is the EMH<br />
Fundamentalists look for reasons why prices should change and realize the change when they find a reason for it to change<br />
EMH theory contends that prices adjust quickly to new information<br />
Technical analysts contend that prices adjust slowly to new information</p>
<p>Almost without exception, EMH studies using autocorrelation and runs tests have found no evidence that prices move in trends.</p>
<p>Strategies<br />
Contrarian - most investors are wrong, so do the opposite<br />
Follow the smart money - “jumping on the bandwagon”</p>
<p>Indictors<br />
Momentum indicators - focus on direction of market<br />
Price- and volume-based indicators - focus on market data</p>
<p>Contrarian Rules<br />
1.) Cash position of mutual funds - need for liquidity (mutual fund ratio = mutual fund cash / total fund assets; a ratio &gt; 11% suggests MF managers are bearish; a ratio &lt; 4% suggests MF managers are bullish)<br />
2.) Investor credit balances in brokerage accounts - need for liquidity (credit balances are uninvested cash)<br />
3.) Opinions of investment advisory services - relative view of analysts<br />
4.) Over-the-counter vs. NYSE volume - Over-the-counter trading is more speculative<br />
5.) CBOE put/call ratio - puts outstanding/calls outstanding<br />
5.) Stock index futures - observe expected price growth</p>
<p>Smart Money Rules<br />
Confidence index = quality bond yields/average bond yields</p>
<p>In periods of confidence, investors sell high-quality bonds (increasing their yields) and buy lower-quality bonds (decreasing their yields), decreasing the yield spread</p>
<p>In periods of pessimism, investors buy high-quality bonds (decreasing their yields) and sell lower-quality bonds (increasing their yields), increasing the yield spread</p>
<p>T-bill-Eurodollar yield spread - measures international crises and use of U.S. safe havens<br />
Debit balances in brokerage accounts (margin debt)</p>
<p>Momentum Indicators<br />
Breadth of market<br />
Stocks above their 200-day moving average</p>
<p>Stock Price and Volume Techniques<br />
Dow Theory - stock prices move in trends<br />
Importance of volume - Price changes on low volume tell us little. Price changes on high volume tell us whether suppliers or demanders are driving the change.</p>
<p>Support and resistance levels<br />
Price Channels</p>
<p>Relative Strength (RS) - RS = stock price / market index value</p>
<p>Underlying technical analysis are the following assumptions:<br />
1) Values, and thus prices, are determined by supply and demand.<br />
2) Supply and demand are driven by both rational and irrational behavior.<br />
3) Security prices move in trends that persist over long periods.<br />
4) While the causes of changes in supply and demand are difficult to determine, the actual shifts in supply and demand can be observed in market price behavior.</p>
<p>The major challenge to technical analysis is the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).</p>
<p>Fundemantalists believe they can forecast value changes by analyzing earnings and other publicly available data.<br />
Fundamentalists belive prices adjust quickly.<br />
EMH advocates believe the price adjustment to new information happens almost instantaneously.<br />
Fundamentalists, through their research, look for changes in the basis of value, which eventually leads to change in the supply and demand for the stock.<br />
Technicians look for evidence of changes in supply and demand through market signals and indicators.</p>
