<h2>Credit Analysis</h2>
<div id="credit-risk" class="section level3">
<h3>Credit Risk</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Default Risk</li>
<li>Credit Spread Risk</li>
<li>Downgrade Risk</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Credit ratings by the nationally recognized rating agencies assess <strong>default</strong> risk only.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="releases-by-rating-agencies" class="section level3">
<h3>Releases by Rating Agencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Credit Rating - reflects the probability of default (short- and long-term debt) and the rate of loss (long-term debt)</li>
<li>Rating Watch - announcement that the rating agency is reviewing a particular issue in advance of a potential rating change</li>
</ul>
<p>Rating Outlook -</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Debt = Current Liabilities + Long-Term Debt</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="high-yield-issuers" class="section level3">
<h3>High-Yield Issuers</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Bank debt
<ul>
<li>Loans acquired from banks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reset notes
<ul>
<li>Bonds whose coupon rates are adjusted periodically</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Senior and Subordinated debt<br />
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>High-yield borrowers typically rely on short-term, floating-rate, senior bank debt.</li>
<li>“Senior Bank Debt” has a higher claim on assets than “Senior Debt.”</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="liquidity" class="section level2">
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<div id="liquidity-factors" class="section level3">
<h3>Liquidity Factors</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Money Supply (traditional guage of liquidity)</li>
<li>Appetite for Risk</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional Banks (Commercial Banks)<br />
* Heavily regulated
* In return for regulation, banks receive (1) deposit insurance (FDIC) and (2) access to the Fed’s discount window (guaranteed source of liquidity)</p>
</div>
<div id="shadow-banking-system" class="section level3">
<h3>Shadow Banking System</h3>
<ul>
<li>The group of non-bank institutions that offer liquidity to the market</li>
<li>The commercial bank’s most important economic role is to accept funds from depositors and lend those funds to borrowers.</li>
<li>Shadow banks raise money from individual investors and provide it directly or indirectly to firms and households, a function that was once exclusively the domain of commercial banks.</li>
<li>Examples of Shadow Banks<br />
+ Hedge funds
+ Private Equity Funds
+ Trading houses
+ Conduits
+ Structured investments
+ REITs
+ Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
+ Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Funding Sources of the Shadow Banking System</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<h2>Term Structure and Volatility of Interest Rates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yield Curve Shifts
1. Parallel shifts
2. Nonparallel shifts: Twists
+ Flattening of curve (lower slope)
+ Steepening of curve (higher slope)
3. Nonparallel shifts: Butterfly
+ Positive butterfly shift (less curvature)
+ Negative butterfly shift (more curvature)</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors Contributing to the Returns on Zero-Coupon Treasury Securities<br />
1.) Parallel shifts in yield curve (90%)<br />
2.) Twists, change in yield curve slope (8.5%)<br />
3.) Butterfly shifts, changes in curvature of yield curve (1.5%)</p>
<p>Yields for Yield Curve<br />
1.) Treasury Coupon Strips<br />
2.) On-the-run Treasury issues<br />
3.) On-the-run Treasury issues and selected off-the-run Treasury issues<br />
4.) All Treasury coupon securities and bills</p>
<p>The liquidity of the strips market is not as great as that of the Treasury coupon market.</p>
<p>A problem with just using on-the-run issues is the large gap between maturities, especially after 5 years.</p>
<p>Swap Curve (LIBOR curve)</p>
<p>Advantages of Using the Swap Curve</p>
<p>Pure Expectations Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates</p>
<p>Liquidity Preference Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates</p>
<p>Preferred Habitat Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates</p>
<p>Valuing Bonds with Embedded Options</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Sector of the Bond Market</p>
<p>Agency Passthrough Securities issued in U.S.<br />
1.) Ginnie Mae - Issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and possess no credit risk<br />
2.) Freddie Mac - Issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)<br />
3.) Fannie Mae - Issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of passthrough securities is their prepayment speed.</p>
<p>Factors Affecting Prepayment Speeds<br />
1.) Prevailing mortage rates<br />
2.) Housing Turnover (interest rate path)<br />
3.) Characteristics of the underlying mortgages</p>
<p>Single Monthly Mortality Rate (SMM)</p>
<p>CMBS typically have some form of loan-level prepayment protection, while residential MBS do not.<br />
CMBS mortgages are structured as non-recourse.</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities, which triggered the financial collapse, were priced using the Gaussian copula model.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBSs)<br />
Securities that are secured by pools of mortgage loans that provide collateral and cash flow backing<br />
Examples: mortgage passthrough securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, stripped mortgage-backed securities</p>
<p>Some GSE’s; namely, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac; purchase mortgages from private lenders to provide funds, that would not otherwise be provided privately, for mortgage loans.</p>
<p>Mortgage Securitization<br />
Process of combining similar debt obligations as collateral for new securities<br />
Increases the debt’s attractiveness to investors<br />
Increases the availability of funds for home mortgages</p>
<p>Mortgage Pass-through Security<br />
Passes the payments made on a pool of mortgages through proportionally to each security holder</p>
<p>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)<br />
??? Securities derived by reallocating the cash flows from mortgage-backed securities or pools of mortgage loans in order to create multiple classes, or tranches, of securities with coupon rates and average lives that differ from the underlying collateral as a whole<br />
??? Although CMO tranches can be structured (through the use of cash flow priority and “support” tranches) to give somewhat more predictable cash flows, the actual future cash flow and hence value of CMOs are subject to change<br />
??? Securities with specific rights that vary from that of MBSs (do not simply pass through a cash flow proportional to the percentage of ownership)</p>
<p>??? Feature multiple “tranches” that feature varying risks and expected cash flows<br />
??? Permit the “redistribution of prepayment risk”<br />
??? Permits the “creation of securities with various maturity ranges”<br />
??? Created to appeal to a wider group of investors so that borrowing costs decline.<br />
??? A CMO is an alternative to mortgage loans and conventional mortgage-backed securities</p>
<p>Stripped MBSs<br />
Either the principal-only (PO) or interest-only (IO) portions of a mortgage passthrough security</p>
<p>Planned Amortization Class (PAC)<br />
A type of tranche that is characterized by a nearly fixed amortization schedule. It is designed to not be subject to prepayment risk.</p>
<p>Some underlying mortgages are insured by the government, providing a credit guarantee in the case of borrower default, but does not provide insurance to tranche investors against changes in interest rates and subsequent prepayments.</p>
<p>A major flaw in mortgage-backed security pricing was the underestimation of the correlation among residential assets. Few priced the securities to account for a potential cascading effect.</p>
<p>Benefits of Structured (Securitized) Assets<br />
1.) Risk Transfer<br />
2.) Liquidity</p>
<p>A securitization is a self-liquidating aset pool that generates cash to repay the bonds that finance the assets’ purchase from the bank that originated them.</p>
<p>Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs)</p>
<p>Asset-Backed Sector of the Bond Market</p>
<p>Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Credit Enhancements<br />
External:<br />
1.) Letters of Credit<br />
2.) Corporate Guarantees<br />
3.) Bond Insurance</p>
<p>Internal:<br />
1.) Reserve Funds<br />
2.) Senior/Subordinated Structure<br />
3.) Over-collateralization<br />
4.) Excess servicing spread accounts</p>
<p>Prepayment tranching is also referred to as time tranching. Prepayment tranching refers to when an asset or mortgage backed security is subdivided so some components are exposed to more prepayment risk than others.</p>
<p>In an asset-backed security backed by non-amortizing assets (e.g. credit cards), the composition of loans in the pool will change. During the lockout period, principal payments are not distributed to bondholders. Instead, new loans are purchased and this structure is referred to as a revolving structure. However, the retirement of principal (i.e. a call provision) in a revolving structure can be triggered by several different events. These events include a specific date, when the collateral falls below a certain level, or when cumulative losses in the collateral reach a certain level.</p>
<p>In an asset-backed security backed by amortizing assets (e.g. automobile loans), the composition of loans in the pool will not change. No new loans are purchased. A lockout period provision refers to an ABS backed by non-amortizing loans.</p>
<p>Countries with efficient legal systems and common-law origin are more likely to have more long-term debt issues by low D/E ratio issuers.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac<br />
Congress created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide liquidity in the mortgage market by allowing these government sponsored enterprises to buy mortgage loans in the secondary market.</p>
<p>In essence, FNMA and FHLMC subsidize the bulk of U.S. mortgages.<br />
FNMA and FHLMC have been the high priests of the religion of home-ownership.</p>
<p>In 2008 the U.S. government took direct control of FNMA and FHLMC amid a housing price spiral and soaring mortgage defaults.</p>
<p>Institutional Loans<br />
Loans mostly funded by investors instead of banks</p>
<p>Covered Bonds<br />
Structured security that is backed by the repayments on a pool of loans, but unlike most asset-backed securities, covered bonds remain ona banks books and stands as a backer to the bonds</p>
<p>Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)<br />
Structured assets that invest in leveraged loans, high-yield bonds and other asset-backed securities.<br />
Sliced into tranches carrying different risks which were sold to investors as bonds or equity.</p>
<p>Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations<br />
A set of repackaged credit default swaps (protection against default on debt, rather than cash or loans)<br />
Gives ivnestors exposure to the credit markets without having to buy the underlying assets</p>
<p>Risk Factors for Structured Securities<br />
1.) Prepayment rates<br />
2.) Default rates<br />
3.) Loss severity</p>
<p>Valuing Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Cash Flow Yield<br />
The yield that equates the present value of a security with its market value and accrued interest (i.e. IRR for MBSs and ABSs)</p>
<p>To determine a cash flow yield, some assumption about the prepayment rate must be made.</p>
<p>The cash flow for MBS and ABSs is usually monthly.</p>
<p>Bond-Equivalent Yield (for MBSs and ABSs)<br />
BEY = 2*[(1+im)6-1]</p>
<p>Yield Spreads<br />
1.) Nominal spread<br />
2.) Zero-Volatility Spread<br />
3.) Option-Adjusted Spread</p>
<p>A trial-and-error procedure is required to determine the zero-volatility spread.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Path-Dependency<br />
Prepayments (cash flows) are sometimes dependent on the path of interest rates, instead of just the current level of interest rate. Not all outstanding mortgages are underwritten at the current interest rate level; some were refinanced when interest rates were even lower than they appear today and there is little incentive to refinance, or prepay, today.</p>
