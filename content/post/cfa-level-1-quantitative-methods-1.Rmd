## Data Types 							

* Nominal - categorize, but do not rank			
* Ordinal - categorize and rank					
* Interval - difference between scale values equal	
* Ratio - abolute zero		

_"N-O-I-R" (French for "black")_

## Descriptive Statistics							
* Involves describing data based on particular metrics

## Inferential Statistics

* Involves making inferences about populations based on samples
* Statistical Inference (forecasts, estimates.)
* Estimation
* Hypothesis Testing

## Leptokurtic Distribution	

* More peaked, fatter tails (pinch the normal distribution)	
* More peaked than normal distribution (excess Kurtosis > 0)

## Platykurtic Distribution 

* Less peaked, compressed tails (press down on normal distribution)
* Less peaked than normal distribution (excess Kurtosis < 0)	* Smaller tails

## Returns				
										
### Arithmetic Mean vs. Geometric Mean			

* The arithmetic mean is the best estimate of a single period's return.				
* The geometric mean is the best estimate of future multi-year annual compound returns.

### Money-Weighted Return						

* IRR on a series of cash flows			

### Time-weighted return			

1. Price the portfolio immediately prior to any significant addition or withdrawal of funds.  Break the overall evaluation period into subperiods based on the dates of cash inflows and outflows.									
2. Calculate the holding period return on the portfolio for each subperiod.
3. Link or compound holding period returns to obtain an annual rate of return for the year (the time-weighted rate of return for the year). If the investment is for more thant one year, take the geometric mean of the annual returns to obtain the time-weighted rate of return over that measurement period.

## Money Market		

* The market for short-term debt (t-bills, commercial paper, etc.)
* T-bills are quoted on a bank-discount basis.			

### Bank-Discount Yield	

* Pure discount securities such as T-bills are quoted differently than government bonds						
* $\mathrm {\large {R_{BD} = \frac{\text{D}} {\text{F}} \times \frac{360} {t}}}$
* Based on face value, not investment price				* Based on 360-day year								* Assumes simple interest			
* Variables:
      + D = discount
      + F = face value
	+ t = days to maturity						
										
### Holding Period Return

* $\mathrm {\large {HPY = \frac{P_{1} - P_{0} + D_{1}} {P_{0}}}}$
* Based on any length of time
* Based on one cash payment during life
* Purchase price and sale price must include Accrued Interest (for bonds)
* Accrued interest = Annual Coupon/2*time held by seller/total time in payment period							

### Effective Annual Yield
										
* $\mathrm {\large {EAY = (1 + HPY)^{365 / t} - 1}}$
									
### Money-Market Yield (CD equivalent yield)	

* $\mathrm {\large {r_{mm} = \frac{360 \ (r_{BD})} {360 - (r_{BD})t} = r_{BD} \frac{F} {P_0}} = HPY \frac{360} {t}}$
* Computed on the purchase price, not Face Value		
				
### Bond-Equivalent Yield	
									
* $\mathrm {\large {BEY = \text{semiannual IRR} \times 2}} $
										
### Time-Weighted Rate of Return	

* Note: Dividends are assumed to be contributed by fund manager
* Note: Dividends are assumed to be held by investor (not reinvested)			
								
## Position of a Percentile	

* $\mathrm {\large {L_y =  \frac{(n+1) \cdot y} {100}}}$
