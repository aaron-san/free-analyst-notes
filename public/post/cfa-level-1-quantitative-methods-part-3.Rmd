## Statistical Inference	

* Hypothesis Testing (testing validity of parameters)													
Estimation (estimation of parameters)														
														
Sampling Bias														
Data Mining														
??? Out-of-Sample Test: using a sample that does not overlap the time period of the variable under consideration														
??? Intergenerational Data Mining: repeatedly using data produced by prior researchers until a pattern is discovered														
??? A data-mining bias occurs when variables are added to an analysis without any predictive merit (i.e., there is no causal relationship for adding the variables). The variables are not added to enhance prediction, but to thwart the predictive relationship between other variables.														
														
Sample Selection Bias														
Using data availability as a criteria for sampling														
														
Survivorship Bias														
Excluding data that is discontinued (defaulted firms)														
														
Look-ahead Bias														
Using data that is not currently available to every market participant														
														
Time-period Bias														
Using data that is inherently influenced by a specific time-period that skews the results														
														
## Estimators		
"UEC"											
* Unbiased				
      * The expected value of the estimator equals the value of the parameter			
* Efficient					
      * The variance of the estimator is the least of all other estimators of the parameter						
* Consistent					
      * The probability that the estimator equals the paramater increases with increasing sample size														
														
## Skewed Distribution	

No Skew:      Mode = Median = Mean														
Left Skew:    Mode > Median > Mean														
Right Skew:  Mode < Median < Mean														
														
	Z	Confidence	Z	Confidence										
	1.65	90%	1	68%										
	1.96	95%	2	95%										
	2.58	99%	3	99%										
														
Confidence Interval 														
Probabilistic interpretation:  __% of the resulting confidence intervals will, in the long run, contain the population parameter														
Practical interpretation:  We are __% confident the given confidence interval contains the population parameter														
														
Total Probability Rule														
Pr(A) = Pr(A|B)Pr(B) + Pr(A|C)Pr(C)														
														
Addtion Rule of Probability														
Pr(A or B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A and B)														
														
Multiplication Rule of Probability														
Pr(A and B) = Pr(A)Pr(B)														
														
Steps in Hypothesis Testing														
1. State hypothesis														
2. Decide on test statistics and probability distribution														
3. Decide on significance level														
4. Decide on decision rule														
5. Collect data and calculate test statistic														
6. Make statistical decision														
7. Make economic decision														
														
Power of  a Test														
The probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis														
Power = 1-$\beta$ = 1-Pr(Type II error)														
														
Labeling														
How many ways can k labels can be assigned to n items														
The number of items that receive label 1 is n1, where n1+n2+n3+.+nk = n														
														
														
														
														
														
Test for Population Mean (Z-stat)														
Assumptions:														
Known variance (or unknown if n>30)														
Normal distribution (or nonnormal if n>30)														
														
Test for Population Mean (T-Stat)														
Assumptions:														
Unknown variance and...														
Either														
1. sample is large (n>30) or...														
2. sample is small, but the population is at least approximately normally distributed														
														
## Test of Mean Differences (T Statistic)	            

* Assumptions:				
      * Normally distributed populations
      * Unknown population variances
      
## Test for Difference Between Means (t-stat)			

* Assumptions:					
      * Normally distributed populations,				
      * Independent populations
      * Population variances unknown, but assumed equal
      
df = n1+n2-2														
																									
														
Assumptions:														
Normally distributed populations														
Independent populations														
Unequal and unknown population variances														
														
														
														
														
														
														
														
														
														
														
														
														
														
In majority of cases, the T-test is used!														
														
Assumptions:														
Normally distributed populations														
Dependent populations														
														
														
														
														
														
Stocks are generally considered to be dependent (both rely on market returns)														
														
		Test Statistic												
When sampling from a:		Small Sample	Large Sample											
		n<30	n>30											
Normal distribution, known variance		z	z											
														
Normal distribution, unknown  variance		t	t or z											
														
Nonnormal distribution, known variance		not available	z	Central Limit Theorem										
														
Nonnormal distribution,  unknown variance		not available	t or z	Central Limit Theorem										
														
														
Types of Risk														
Default risk - risk that a security will lose value due to a firm's default														
Liquidity risk - risk of receiving less than the fair value for an asset if it must be sold quickly														
Maturity risk - risk of higher volatility of longer maturity instruments (particularly with bonds)														
										
RRORbond = real risk-free rate + inflation premium + default risk premium + liquidity premium + maturity premium

## Test for Variance (1 population - $??^2$)	

* Assumptions:	
* Normally distributed population														
$??^2$ distribution approaches the normal distribution as the sample size increases

## Test for Equality of Variances (2 populations - F-dist)	

* Assumptions:					
      * Normally distributed populations
      * Independent distributions														
Rejection region is in the right tail of the F-distribution (if s21 is the greater sample variance)

## Power of a Test			

* 1-P(Type II Error)
