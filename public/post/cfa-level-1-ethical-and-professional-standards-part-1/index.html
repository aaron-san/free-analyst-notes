Composites must include all fee-paying, discretionary portfolios</p>
<p>A composite includes all discretionary, fee-paying portfolios that are managed according to the same strategy, objective, or mandate. Non-discretionary portfolios are not included. The firm must choose the composite in which each portfolio will be included on an ex-ante basis (prior to any investment results) according to predetermined criteria, so that the firm cannot selectively include only the best-performing portfolios in a composite.</p>
<p>Major Sections of GIPS<br />
1.) Fundamentals of Compliance<br />
2.) Input Data<br />
3.) Calculation methodology<br />
4.) Composite construction<br />
5.) Disclosures<br />

Verification is not required<br />
Verification can be performed by an independent 3rd party only<br />
Must be in whole compliance with GIPS to claim compliance<br />
Cannot claim partial compliance</p>
<p>Verification must be applied on a firm-wide basis; there is no such thing as verification of results for a single composite or portion of the firm’s performance. A verification report must be provided upon request, only. Verification must be performed by an independent third party, which does not have to be a public accounting firm.</p>
<p>Presenting GIPS-compliant performance only since the firm’s inception is acceptable. Five years is the minimum if the firm has been in existence five years or more.</p>
<p>The firm must add annual performance results each year going forward up to a minimum of ten years of performance history.</p>
